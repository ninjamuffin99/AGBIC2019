JI-EUN

Ji-eun is looking over her balcony at the cityscape. 
The streets are busy with cars and streetlights, 
while the sky is busy with stars and clouds.
Something not so out of the ordinary happened earlier in the day.
She got a package delivered to her door.
However there was something out of the ordinary ABOUT the package.
It was unmarked. Non-standard.
Every package has either a seal or stamp or some marking on it.
This is just a plain box.
She heard a knock at her door, opened it up, and there was nothing but this mystery package.
For the past 10 minutes she's been contemplating what to do with it.
Should she open it? What if it isn't actually her's?
Should she return it? But to where?
Maybe just simply toss it over the balcony and see what happens.









FINN

"Hey man if 'your guy' doesn't show up, then you're screwed."
Finn knows this. He knows that this specific shipment was more important than all the other ones.
